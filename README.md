# over-to-nether-helper
this helper will give nether/overworld coordinates in minecraft if given coordinates of a given parallel. the overworld is 8 times bigger than the nether so for an example, overworld coordinates, 80, 64, 458, will come to 10, 64, 57 in the nether. we don't convert the y coordinate. this can help link up nether portals!
